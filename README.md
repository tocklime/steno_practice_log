Since 12/6/24 I've been working through [Lapwing for beginners](https://lapwing.aerick.ca).

I started using my ergodoxes to type on, but at the start of July built a YASK steno keyboard to type on.

## 2024-07-10 (Day 28)

Working on lapwing chapter 13 test. Very slow, but have just about cemented the suffixes in my fingers. Some inacurracies as I still learn the new keyboard.

* 12wpm, 85% accuracy

## 2024-07-11 (Day 29)

Passed chapter 13 test (just - 90.37% accuracy, 12 wpm). Moved onto chapter 14. Ran through the suffix keys and compound words drills. Chap 14 has no test, so onto 15 tomorrow.

## 2024-07-12 (Day 30)

Did the first drill in chapter 15. Took me half an hour (9wpm, but had the hints up for the first 2 repetitions, then hidden for the third). 82%, but I think worse than that. Had to look things up some. Pretty sure I'm going to be here for a while.
Second attempt at the same drill: 10wpm, 84% (hints off until mistake).

## 2024-07-133 (Day 31)

Staying on the first exercise in chapter 15. Feel like I want it to be solid and quick before I move on. 11wpm, 85.92%.
