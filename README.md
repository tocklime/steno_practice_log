Since 12/6/24 I've been working through [Lapwing for beginners](https://lapwing.aerick.ca).

I started using my ergodoxes to type on, but at the start of July built a YASK steno keyboard to type on.

Working on lapwing chapter 13 test. Very slow, but have just about cemented the suffixes in my fingers. Some inacurracies as I still learn the new keyboard.

* 12wpm, 85% accuracy

## 2024-07-11 (Day 29)

Passed chapter 13 test (just - 90.37% accuracy, 12 wpm). Moved onto chapter 14. Ran through the suffix keys and compound words drills. Chap 14 has no test, so onto 15 tomorrow.
