Slightly arbitrary start date: [12/06/2024](http://howmanydayssince.net/06/12/2024)

Since 12/6/24 I've been working through [Lapwing for beginners](https://lapwing.aerick.ca).

I started using my ergodoxes to type on, but at the start of July built a YASK steno keyboard to type on.

## 2024-07-10 (Day 28)

Working on lapwing chapter 13 test. Very slow, but have just about cemented the suffixes in my fingers. Some inacurracies as I still learn the new keyboard.

* 12wpm, 85% accuracy

## 2024-07-11 (Day 29)

Passed chapter 13 test (just - 90.37% accuracy, 12 wpm). Moved onto chapter 14. Ran through the suffix keys and compound words drills. Chap 14 has no test, so onto 15 tomorrow.

## 2024-07-12 (Day 30)

Did the first drill in chapter 15. Took me half an hour (9wpm, but had the hints up for the first 2 repetitions, then hidden for the third). 82%, but I think worse than that. Had to look things up some. Pretty sure I'm going to be here for a while.
Second attempt at the same drill: 10wpm, 84% (hints off until mistake).

## 2024-07-133 (Day 31)

Staying on the first exercise in chapter 15. Feel like I want it to be solid and quick before I move on. 11wpm, 85.92%.

## 2024-07-14 (Day 32)
Same test. 14wpm, 88.88%. Know /what/ i'm doing. Just need to do it with more accuracy.
2nd exercise in chap 15 (KWR joining) 7wpm, 71%

## 2024-07-15 (Day 33)
Ch 15, ex 2 again. 9wpm 80%, then 12wpm, 89.62%. I got fed up of the american pronounciation in 'airogant' and 'airomatic', so have started my own `british_pronounciations.json` dictionary.

## 2024-07-16 (Day 34)
Lapwing ch 15, exercise 3. 5wpm, 53.3%. Yikes that was hard. The-ya-tri-cal. Even N-eye-eve tripped me up more than once. Lots of words I don't know, let alone know how an american would say them (not got round to configuring warbler yet).

## 2024-07-17 (Day 35)
Lapwing ch 15, exercise 3. 9wpm, 73.33%. Improving. Have got my [dictionaries](https://github.com/tocklime/plover_dictionaries) set up now, so hopefully less confusion on pronounciation.

## 2024-07-18 (Day 36)
Lapwing ch 15 test. 11wpm, 86.66%. Much closer that I thought it was going to be, and that included some accidental presses because my fingers are too heavy...

## 2024-07-19 (Day 37)
Lapwing ch 15 test again. 14wpm, 86.66%. Faster but exactly as wrong. interesting.
