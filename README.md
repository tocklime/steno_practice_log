Since 12/6/24 I've been working through [Lapwing for beginners](https://lapwing.aerick.ca).

I started using my ergodoxes to type on, but at the start of July built a YASK steno keyboard to type on.

Working on lapwing chapter 13 test. Very slow, but have just about cemented the suffixes in my fingers. Some inacurracies as I still learn the new keyboard.
